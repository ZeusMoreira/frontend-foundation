Landing page developed from a prototype interface, focusing on responsiveness, layout organization, and CSS best practices.

The project's objective was to practice building modern layouts using only HTML, CSS, and Tailwind.

---

## Applied Concepts

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Grid for main structure
- Flexbox for internal alignments
- Position (relative/absolute)
- Responsiveness with Tailwind's utility-first approach
- Code organization and separation of responsibilities

---

##  Technical Decisions

- Main structure built with Grid for better section control
- Internal components organized with Flexbox
- Mobile-first approach
- Some breakpoints manually adjusted to maintain fidelity to the prototype
